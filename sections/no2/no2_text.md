## Satellite Observed Tropospheric NO2 Concentration

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASAâ€™s Aura satellite esimtat concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), emitted by motor vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities. 

For this analysis we have used  the variable  Tropospheric Cloud Screened NO2, extracted from the Level 3 gridded product OMNO2d.003.
