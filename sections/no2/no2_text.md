## Satellite Observed Tropospheric NO₂ Concentration

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA’s Aura satellite estimates of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), emitted by motor vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities. 

For this analysis we have used  the variable  Tropospheric Cloud Screened NO2, extracted from the Level 3 gridded product OMNO2d.003.
